- Looking at the photo above we can discect what variables contribute to MPG according to the multiple linear regression: Vehicle Length, Weight and Ground Cleareance have a p value of less than the significance level of 0.05 and would contribute to the MPG of a car significantly

-From the photo above, Lot 3 Suspension Coils do not meet the manufacturing specifications that the variance should not exceed 100 lbs per square inch.

- From this screenshot we can conclude that the Suspension coils in Lot 3 are different than the rest of the group PSI wise
- All other groups did not vary since their P-Value was above the significance level of 0.05
